# This file contains examples demonstrating the zero-based optimizations

# Addition
>Addition: Adding zero should not change the value.
>OptimizeOff
AB+0+

>Addition: With optimizations on, the AD and intermediate ST/LD is skipped.
>OptimizeOn
AB+0+

>Addition: Adding a value to zero should result in that value.
>OptimizeOff
0AB++

>Addition: With optimizations on, we go directly to that value 
>OptimizeOn
0AB++

>Subtraction: Subtracting zero from a number should not change the value
>OptimizeOff
AB*0-

>Subtraction: With optimizations on, we skip the operation.
>OptimizeOn
AB*0-

>Multiplication: This expression should reduce to zero.
>OptimizeOff
AB+0*

>Multiplication: With optimizations on, it does.
>OptimizeOn
AB+0*

>Division: Zero divded by a number should equal zero
>OptimizeOff
0AB*/

>Division: With optimizations on, we go directly to zero (mostly).
>OptimizeOn
0AB*/

>Division: Division by zero is undefined and will result in a rejected expression
>OptimizeOff
ABC*+0/

>Division: This is true whether or not optimizations are enabled.
>OptimizeOn
ABC*+0/
